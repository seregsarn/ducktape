<h1> DUCK TAPE HERO </h1>
<blockquote>
    There is a place in the wilderness, far from any lake or pond. A deep place, hidden within the earth, where dark creatures lurk.
    Among the Anatidae, it is known as the Darkness Below. Eons ago, the dark god of the hominids stole the Grapes of Yendor from the creator,
    and fled to the Darkness Below with it. It is spoken in whispers that one day, a brave hero, barely a hatchling, will enter the Darkness
    Below and return with the Grapes to lead the Anatidae to greatness.<br><br>
    
    Now, that time has come. You, a flightless youngling barely out of his first molting, were turned down by the Elders when you petitioned
    for permission to raid the Darkness Below. Spurning their cowardice, you set out for the dungeon with only your trusty roll of duct tape
    to defend yourself. Your mission: To survive the dungeon, find the Grapes of Yendor, and escape with your life.

<h2> Intro </h2>
<p> Welcome to Duck Tape Hero, my 7DRL for 2018! In this roguelike, you take on the role of a heroic duck and delve a dungeon for the
legendary Grapes of Yendor. You do this by collecting items and using duct tape to assemble them into useful tools.</p>
<p> As I often do, I bit off way more than I could reasonably chew this year: A plan which sounded simple at first but turned out to be overly
ambitious, plus picking up a new framework/library (<a href="http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/">rot.js</a>) to boot. In order to get the game
completed in the available time for the 7drl, I had to cut an awful lot of content I had planned, so this game is a bit thin on the ground.
Someday I might come back and extend it with all the stuff I intended to make but didn't have time for.</p>

<h2> How to Play </h2>
<p> You can move your duck around the dungeon with the numpad. (The arrow keys and WASD will also work, but you won't be able to move diagonally
with just those.) Most actions are context-aware, and are described by the user interface. For example, when you stand on a staircase, the game
will prompt you to press <span class="key">Space</span> to go down it.</p>
<p> Pressing <span class="key">I</span> will open your inventory screen. This screen lets you view all your items and use your duct tape to
assemble and dismantle useful tools. Use the arrow keys or numpad to select an item from the list, and then press one of the action keys.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pressing <span class="key">C</span> will load the item into the "duct tape" box at the bottom of the inventory window. To combine two
        items, combine each in turn. If your combination is successful, you'll get a notification of the new item.</li>
    <li>Press <span class="key">X</span> to try and dismantle the item into its component parts, if it is built of smaller items.</li>
    <li>Press <span class="key">E</span> to equip weapons or armor, which contributes to your combat skills.</li>
    <li>Press <span class="key">Enter</span> to use the selected item. The effects will vary by item-- some items can't be used at all, while
        some might require a target or a direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a convenient shorthand, pressing <span class="key">F</span> is a shortcut key that automatically shoots with the most powerful ranged
weapon you have, just as if you had selected the item in the inventory screen and pressed Enter to use it.</p>
<p>Pressing <span class="key">*</span> during play will toggle emoji displays on and off. If your browser supports the emoji, they're pretty
cute, but if not then it can reduce the game's playability because everything looks like a wall.</p>


<h2> Enemies and Hazards </h2>
<p> A lot of content got cut for time, including most planned enemies and hazards. As a result, there's only a few things to watch out for in
this version of the game:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="symbol" style="color: yellow;">f</span> <b>Astrojags</b> - A deadly predator to magical beasts such as Anatidae. </li>
    <li><span class="symbol" style="color: orange;">F</span> <b>Dire astrojags</b> - More dangerous than a normal astrojag. </li>
    <li><span class="symbol" style="color: green;">M</span> <b>Duckeater</b> - Like an anteater, but for ducks. </li>
    <li><span class="symbol" style="color: orange;">~</span> <b>Lava</b> - Very hot. Do not eat. </li>
    <li><span class="symbol" style="color: rgb(192,255,192);">~</span> <b>Razorgrass</b> - Very Sharp. Do not pet. </li>
</ul>
